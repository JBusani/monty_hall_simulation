/*The goal is to run a simulation of the problem 10,000 times and demonstrate that it is indeed a 2/3 chance of winning by switching your door
choice vs a 1/3 chance of winning by keeping your original choice. Put these results in either results.txt or results.jpg depending on if itâ€™s text
based or a screen shot*/

//rules:
//1. The host must always open a door that was not picked by the contestant.
//2. The host must always open a door to reveal a goat and never the car [done]
//3. The host must always offer the chance to switch between the originally chosen door and the remaining closed door.

/*
    HOW TO RUN SIMULATION:

        Scroll to the bottom of the file and insert the number of times you want to run the simulation into the run() function.

        for example:

        To run the simulation 10 times, write:
            run(10);
